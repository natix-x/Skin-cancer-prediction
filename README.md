# Skin-cancer-prediction 

The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model that predicts to which category a pigmented skin lesion belongs.
Distinguished 3 categories: "melanocytic nevi (nv)", "melanoma (mel)" and "other".

The dataset used in this project is obtained from [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T).
To work with this repository download and extract the dataset in 'DATA' directory.

## Data preparation and analysis

1. Check if dataset is imbalanced or not.
2. Analysis of file 'HAM10000_metadata' - Data overview & distribution plots
3. Classify all available diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions into three groups: 'melanocytic nevi (nv)', 'melanoma (mel)' and 'other'.
'other' category includes  actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec), basal cell carcinoma (bcc), benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, bkl), dermatofibroma (df) and vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, vasc).
4. Do analysis and check imbalance again.

## Machine Learning Models
